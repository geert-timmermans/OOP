##  Objective

As you can see, we can integrate PHP into HTML. However, it quickly becomes difficult to read with the successive opening and closing of PHP tags and the alternation between PHP and HTML.

We will minimize this alternation as much as possible by creating PHP classes that will generate HTML directly.

You will understand for example. Imagine a form of a modification page.

```
<form action = "<?php echo $ action;?>" method = "POST">
    <input name = "name" value = "<?php echo $name ?>">
    <input name = "firstname" value = "<?php echo $ firstname ?>">
    <input type = "submit" value = "Edit">
</form>
```

The variables $ action, $ name and $ first have values ​​directly retrieved from the database.

As you can see, HTML and PHP are mixed.

To minimize this, we can create a Form class that handles form generation. We will have a little more legible code.


```Php
<?php
    echo $form = new Form();
    echo $form->create($action); // create the start of the form
    echo $form->text('name', $name); // create an input of type text with as default $ name
    echo $form->text('firstname', $firstname); // create an input of type text with as default $ firstname
    echo $form->submit('Modify'); // Create a button to submit the form naming Edit
    echo $form->end(); // close the form
?>
```

We juggle less with the opening and closing of php <? Php?> Tags.

There are many other benefits of using PHP to generate HTML, including the power of PHP to customize the code generated by a simple parameter :)

Create a `Form` class that will generate the different elements of the form.
For the `Form` class You do not have to rely on the example above.

This class should have methods and properties to be able to generate:

- The beginning of a form `<form ...>`
- An input text `<input type ="text"...>`
- A select `<select ...> ... </ select>`
- A submit button `<button type ="submit"> </ button>`
- A textarea `<textarea ...> ... </ textarea>`
- A radio button `<textarea ...> ... </ textarea>`
- A checkbox `<input type ="radio"...>`

You must create this class thinking that it will be used by another developer.
Use meaningful property names and methods, stay simple, and comment on your code.

Create a class Html (in a separate file) that will generate different HTML elements:

Link CSS Files <link rel ="stylesheet"...>
Create Meta Tags <meta ...>
Link Images to <img src = "...">
Create Links <a href="...">
Link JavaScript Files
